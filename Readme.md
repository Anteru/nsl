NSL
===

(original author: Matth√§us G. Chajdas)

`nsl` is a source-to-source compiler aimed at providing a meta-shading-language which will eventually get compiled to HLSL, GLSL and plain C. The main goal is flexibility and easy hacking.

Requirements
------------

All you need is a working Python 3 installation. `nsl` has been tested with Python 3.4. In a virtualenv, install the dependencies as specified in  `requirements.txt`.

Running
-------

To run the tests, simply invoke `./run_tests.sh` from the main directory. To see it compile, use `nsl.py`, which parses a small example shader and pretty prints it back to the console after all compiler passes have been run.

Status
------

What's working?

* A lexer/parser built on [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/)
* An abstract syntax tree is generated
* A type computation/legalization pass. This pass resolves overloaded functions, operators, and computes all types.
* Pretty printing
* Various debug outputs
* A minimal standard library

What's missing from making this useful?

* A code generator for GLSL/HLSL
* The standard library lacks many functions and classes (textures, etc.)
