NSL
===

`nsl` is a source-to-source compiler aimed at providing a meta-shading-language which will eventually get compiled to HLSL, GLSL and plain C. The main goal is flexibility and easy hacking.

Requirements
------------

Python 3 is all that is needed. Tested with Python 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Python 3.0 is not recommended.
